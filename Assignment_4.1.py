
Problem Statement: 4.1

You survey households in your area to find the average rent they are paying. Find the standard deviation from the following data:

1550, 1700, 900, 850, 1000, 950.


I Step : To find the standard deviation, we need to find the Mean of all the data.

(1550 + 1700 + 900 + 850 + 1000 + 950)/6 = 1158.33


II Step : We have to Subtract the mean from each value. This gives you the differences:
1550 – 1158.33 = 391.67
1700 – 1158.33 = 541.67
900 – 1158.33 = -258.33
850 – 1158.33 = -308.33
1000 – 1158.33 = 158.33
950 – 1158.33 = 208.33


III Step : Squareing the differences
391.672 = 153405.3889
541.672 = 293406.3889
-258.332 = 66734.3889
-308.332 = 95067.3889
158.332 = 25068.3889
208.332 = 43401.3889


IV Step : Add up all of the squares you found in Step III:
      And divide by 5 ( 6 – 1)
(153405.3889 + 293406.3889 + 66734.3889 + 95067.3889 + 25068.3889 + 43401.3889) / 5 = 135416.667

Step IV: Find the square root of the number you found in Step IV (the variance):
    
135416.667 = 367.99

The obtained value of  standard deviation  = 367.99.
